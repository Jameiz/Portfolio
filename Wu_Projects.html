          In Project Compound 1.1.6, the objective was to combine at least 4 different simple machines to create a machine that would increase the efficiency in an everyday activity; our final design allowed the user to feed their fish by turning a wheel manually. My responsibilities in this project were to come up with the initial design of our product and make further improvements as well as edits on it. I also recorded my findings by taking pictures and collaborating with my group about my thoughts and their recommendations. I was mainly in charge of the documentation, recording measurements, and final calculations. Our final prototype had a total IMA of 30.006. In this project, I learned the interactions between the 6 simple machines and how to combine them for more efficient results. One example would be combining a complex gear train with a pulley system to increase either the torque or the speed of the machine. Through this project, I was able to demonstrate team cooperation, effective communication, as well as team leadership since I came up with the initial sketch and assigned specific roles to other group members. Furthermore, I demonstrated sufficient technical skills through building part of the final prototype and problem-solving skills by designing and testing out multiple variations of the prototype for the highest IMA.

           In Project 2.1.4 Aerodynamic Design, the objective was to first design a rocket-shaped projectile that could withstand 70 psi of pressure and reach the farthest horizontal distance possible. Everyone in this project had to come up with their design which would later be compiled into one data table. My responsibilities in this project were to design my projectile and to physically launch the rockets on launch day. From the results of this project, I learned that the pressure cap has to be strong enough to withstand at least 70 psi of pressure; I had seen many rockets explode upon launch due to ineffective pressure cap. More importantly, I learned that the tip of the rocket is perhaps the most important aspect when it comes to aerodynamics. Having a longer and more pointy tip increases the initial velocity which ultimately results in more horizontal distance traveled. I also observed that the wings have to be perfectly symmetric to provide balance for the rocket, otherwise the wings tend to flop around while in flight. My trial design had an initial velocity of 57.13 ft/sec and a horizontal displacement of 102 feet. My final design had an initial velocity of 111.71 ft/sec and a horizontal displacement of 390 feet. Through this project, I exemplified my logical thinking and problem-solving skills by improving upon my initial design and almost tripling the distance traveled in my final design. I also exemplified that I can effectively work in groups by sharing design ideas with my teammates and overall communicating with each other about different design potentials. The rubric of this project can be found  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uAtXHZMt3D01OQyQBJPC9AVVbxTOf6tr_gqzMFDKYVY/edit">here.</a>

          In Project 3.2.4, our task was to design a vehicle that could deliver some form of materials from point A to point B. Our proposed solution was essentially a tank that can shoot objects as a form of delivery. Through this project, I exemplified my skills of social communication with my group members as we had many debates over whether or not our vehicle should use tank tracks or wheels. I also demonstrated my documentation and coding skills as I often looked over the code of my group members and I played a major role in recording our progress. I also showed creative problem-solving skills because building a tank as a delivery vehicle is not a mainstream design solution. I was responsible for building the physical prototypes of the vehicle and was in charge of cable management. I was largely impactful in the design of the canon of the vehicle and in the program at times. Additionally, I contributed to troubleshooting the vehicle in both the physical parts and the RobotC Program. Furthermore, I was responsible for a decent amount of online documentation, including the descriptions for the final physical design and for the decision matrix. Our group was very cooperative and we went through this project with minimal challenges or disputes.
