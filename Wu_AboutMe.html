           Hi! I'm James Wu and I'm currently a junior at Dublin High School. I am extremely interested in the fields of biomedical and mechanical engineering, and I plan to take multiple college and high school courses that are related to these fields. I have always had a passion to mechanical design, and I developed my love for biology throughout my high school career. 
            </br></br>
            My skills in engineering are exemplified in creative problem solving and teamwork. An example of my creative problem solving and logical thinking skills in action is when I helped to design a parachute for an egg drop test in 8th grade. Before designing our final model, I observed and recorded many mistakes of the groups that have already begun building. My observations ultimately allowed me to logically come up with solutions to problems that have been discovered by other teams, which saved our group plenty of time and taught us what not to do. I was also able to effectively lead my group and avoid social conflicts, which increased our work efficiency. 
            </br></br>
            I am proficient in English, Mandarin, and French. For my skills, I have acquired an abundance of experience in working with groups; thus, I have lots of transferable skills such as teamwork and effective leadership. I am also academically capable to a certain extent. 
            </br></br> In conclusion, I discovered that I tend to be more productive when there's a deadline involved, however, procrastination is still one of the issues that I intend to fix. In group assignments, I can lighten the mood and bring more productivity to our team.
